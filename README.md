### Southwest Technical College
#### Intro To Programming

This repository is for documenting assignments and showing my work.

My name is Nic Farish, and I am 33 years old. I have worked in a few industries, but decided it was time to find a long term career. I have always been very interested in computers but thought that I would not enjoy coding. One day I started teaching myself how to build websites and fell in love with it. But I wanted to go deeper into development, so I came to this program.

My reason for taking this course is to get into the industry and start gaining experience while I continue my bachelor degree.
